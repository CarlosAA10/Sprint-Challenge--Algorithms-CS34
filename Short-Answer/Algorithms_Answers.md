#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This function is considered to be 0(n), because the while loop statement increments significatly bigger than the a variable, so it will takea  good bit of n amount of steps to reach the condition to break the while loop. As the N numbers get larger, the more steps it will take to reach the condition to break out of the while loop

b)This function has a run time of 0(n log n), first because of the for loop statement for i in range(n), it will go on for a considerable amount of n steps, however the while loop statement inside of it has a log n run time because the j is not looping or incrementing by 1 for n amount of steps, it increments by a multiplication of 2, making it reach it's while loop conditional statement much faster than if it were to increment by 1. 


c) The runtime of this function is 0(n), because the rate at which the bunnies are decreased is by 1, therefore it would take n amount of steps to reach the "if bunnies == 0" condition, and would increase by n steps if bunnies were increased to a larger number.
